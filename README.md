## Getting started

The stack is built using [vue-cli webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) so to get started all you have to do is:

``` bash
# install dependencies
> yarn install
# serve the clinet and the server with hot reload at localhost:8080
> yarn serve
```

Other commands available are:

``` bash
# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn run test:unit
```
